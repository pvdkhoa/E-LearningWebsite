            <h2>Online IELTS Listening Practice Tests</h2>
            <p>The IELTS Listening test will take about 30 minutes, and you will have an extra 10 minutes to transfer
                your answers to the answer sheet.

                <br>The four parts of this practice Listening test are presented over four separate web pages. Make sure
                you move swiftly from one page to the next so that your practice is as realistic as possible.
                <br>
                <br>Download the question paper and blank answer sheet before you start, and write your answers on the
                question paper while you are listening. Use a pencil.
                <br>
                <br>Listen to the instructions for each section of the test carefully. Answer all of the questions.There
                are 40 questions altogether. Each question carries one mark.
                <br>
                <br>For each part of the test, there will be time for you to look through the questions and time for you
                to check your answers.When you have completed all four parts of the Listening test you will have ten
                minutes to copy your answers on to a separate answer sheet.
                <br>
                <br>We can make special arrangements for test takers with disabilities. If you require a modified
                version of the test, for example, in Braille, contact your test centre three months in advance to
                discuss your requirements.
            </p>
